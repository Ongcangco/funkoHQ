Funko HQ: an app that allows collectors to track their collection. It will have a list of items already in their collection that tracks value and the pops that they already do have. Another section of the app also allows for the users to create a whole different set of list that allows them to input items that they would like to have, where it would ultimately be like a buy/sell/trade area where other users could essentially have access to it and be able to chat with one another. 
Technology: MongoDB, CSS, HTML, JS

Getting Started: The idea is an app that allows collectors to track their collection and to be able to talk/chat/buy/sell/trade with one another.
IceBox Items: The collection section I would love to be able to calculate actual value of the items, attach it to another database that tracks what the items have been selling for. I want the wish list page to be able to be visible to other users, with a searchbar, where they can search up a pop they maybe want to sell or trade for and be able to message that persons account. 
Biggest challenge was the entirety of the project. I think for this unit it went extremely fast, and everything really was in one ear out the other.And even in coding the deliverables I felt like I just had to go faster on some parts so that I wasnt constantly trying to catch up. 
Takeaway- Practice! Always just practice!
